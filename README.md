STUDENTS GRADES

This is a simple program that prompts the user to input a student's mark and then outputs the corresponding grade. The program only accepts marks between 0 and 100. The grades are assigned as follows:

A > 79
B > 60 to 79
C > 59 to 49
D > 40 to 49
E > less than 40

SPEED DETECTOR

The program takes in the speed of the car as input and checks whether the speed is less than or greater than the speed limit. If the speed is less than or equal to the speed limit, it prints "Ok". If the speed is greater than the speed limit, it calculates the number of fine points the driver gets and prints it. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".
